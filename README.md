# SheSafe

"SheSafe" is a comprehensive women's safety project that combines three levels of protection with dedicated safety devices. The project includes a secure women-only chat platform for community building, a family and friends support system with live location sharing and direct calling, and a third level connecting women to a network of "Women Avengers" and law enforcement for immediate assistance. Additionally, "SheSafe" incorporates innovative safety devices such as earrings and bracelets, enhancing the safety and security of women in various situations. This holistic approach aims to empower women, reduce violence, and promote safety and solidarity within the community.
